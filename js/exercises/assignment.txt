Using call/apply/bind, write a function that will return square root of a number
  1. Use typeof/instanceof to verify the type of data being passed to the function
  2. This function has to be enclosed from the outside scope
  3. This function should work for the values - 0, 1, 3, 4, 9
  4. Same number should be returned if there is no perfect square root found for the given number
